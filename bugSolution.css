The following CSS code provides a more robust solution by including a default outline, while still respecting `:focus-visible` for a more refined focus indication:

```css
.my-element {
  outline: 1px solid lightgray; /* Default subtle outline */
}

.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

This solution ensures that a focus indication is always visible, and yet, uses `:focus-visible` to provide a more visually distinct focus style when appropriate. This avoids the accessibility pitfalls of the original code.
